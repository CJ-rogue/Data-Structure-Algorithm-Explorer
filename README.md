## Introduction
- The Data Structure & Algorithm Explorer is an educational interactive tool developed in Java using NetBeans GUI. 
- It provides a user-friendly interface to learn and simulate various data structures and algorithms. 
- This tool is designed to enhance understanding by allowing users to visualize and interact with the concepts of data structures and algorithms.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in NetBeans.
2. Enter five numbers on the front page to be processed.
3. Choose between exploring Data Structures or Algorithms.
4. Explore the operations and simulations available for each data structure or algorithm.
